I found out that as at the time this analysis was made(June 2022) that Nigeria my country has  118,757,137 confirmed cases,  1,573,076 death cases and  39,492,087 recovered at the rate of 1%

# Recommendation
1. Countries with the lowest prevalence of covid-19 security measures should be investigated and adopted by other countries of the world incase such pandemic might beak out again
2. United states of America (World Power) having the highest number of confirmed cases and the highest case of death maybe due to climatic condition. It proves that Corona Virus has a strong life span and high tendency of surviving more in regions located in and around the US hence effective measures must be taken.
